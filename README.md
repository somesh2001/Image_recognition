# Image_recognition
## Problem Statement
Development of the mobile application for the assessment of fruit and vegetable health and provide the calories, recipe suggestion and ingredients by identifying the item using AI based image recognition approach 

## Objectives
The objective of this work is to propose a mobile system which assists a user to decide what and how to cook using Image recognition technology<br />
1. To develop AI and ML based mobile application<br />
2. To detect the item (fruit or vegetable).<br />
3. To suggest or recommend the recipe for the detected item.<br />
4. To provide the amount of calories user gets from the fruit or vegetable.<br />
5. To analyse the quality of the fruit or Vegetable and accordingly give the result.<br />

## Technology Used

#### Deep Learning <br/>
Convolution Neural Network is been used for image recognition.<br />
#### Android<br />
Android is based on the Linux kernel long-term support branch. Its user interface is based on direct-manipulation, meaning it was designed for touchscreen devices, responding to swiping, tapping<br />
#### Java<br />
Java has platform independent feature so it is used for android development. Java is very popular language due to its awesome features and performance. Java is machine independent and runs only in JVM space . Using Java we are performing several events in android
#### XML <br/>
XML is been used in order to create the user interface of the application.
#### 000Webhost <br/>
000Webhost is been used to host the Mobile application. This makes the application completely dynamic, In real time way data is been fetched and send to the server
#### MYSQL <br/>
MYSQL is used for database and SQL Query is been implemented at the backedend in order to fetch the data from the database.
